1) discretionary management
2) mutual funds
3) hedge funds

discretionary management
------------------------
Hiring a private investor to manage your money
typically requires minimum (ex >30k) to invest, so they can adequately diversify (because one stock could be $1000 and buy at least 30)

What if not have a lot of money --> fund

mutual funds
------------
1) investment company collects funds
2) distribute units of the fund (showing how much each owns)
3) invest money in portfolio
4) split returns

Why? 
- save costs and can fully imnplement strategy 
- sometimes have representatives to answer questions
- can get in with like $10

Hedge fund
----------
only high net worth investors can participate
Why? because riskier types of investments, investors must be accreddited and afford to lose money
    Ex riskier: money in bankrupt buisness
less regulation: Don't have to report their returns
