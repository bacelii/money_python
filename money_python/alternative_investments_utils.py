Traditional investments: 
1) stocks
2) bonds
3) Cash Equivalents: easly converted to cash, small interest rates (low return)
    types:
    - savings account
    - guaranteed investment certificate (GIC) : pays you interest rate but locks in your money
        --> Canadian based
    - CDs: same but USA based, and insured by FDIC for up to 250,000
    - Money Market Instruments (comercial papers, repurchase agreements..):
        like bonds but given by company looking to raise money
        typically less than a year and only pays interest at the end of the term


Alternative Investements:
---------------
1) Real Estate (commercial or residential)
- two sources of return: 1) capital appreciation 2) rent/leasing
- what if don't have fortune to buy property?
    REIT (Real estate investment trust): buy up properties and sell part ownership, divide profits (distributions)
        favorable taxes
        helps diversify
    Mortage back security: lends lots of mortages and then sells a part, divies up the mortage payments
2) Commodities: oil, wheat, gold
    Capital appreciation: purchase becasue think will be able to sell them later at higher price
    Problem: physical product so would have to move it
3) Derivative: something that derives their value from seomthing
    Ex: options, futures, swaps
    AKA a bet if something goes up or down
    Why use? 
        1) can mimick the return of something as if you actually owned something
        2) Use to hedge your risk:
            Ex: if company relies on oil, could bet that oil prices go down, so if it does happen, the bet would offset what losses you would occur
    Warning: some derivatives don't have a price until they are sold
